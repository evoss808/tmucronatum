### A Mesoamerican Symbol
Rising from the banks of streams and riparian edges, the Montezuma cypress, *Taxodium mucronatum*, establishes a presence of strength and beauty that personifies a powerful and enduring people. Recognized as the national tree of <span eid="Q96">Mexico</span>, the Montezuma cypress plays a significant role in <span eid="Q13703">Mesoamerican</span> history and development of indigenous cultures. The complexity of ecological systems and topographic conditions throughout the Mesoamerican region facilitated the development of unique forms of government, agriculture, mythology, and science, among others. Through its role in mythology and agricultural systems, the Montezuma cypress stakes itself firmly in the narrative as an agent that enabled the growth and stability of some of the world’s most dominant ancient societies.

One of the most recognized civilizations in Mexico are the <span eid="Q12542">Aztecs</span>, who were members of the indigenous group <span eid="Q826591">Nahuas</span>. In <span eid="Q13300">Nahuatl</span>, the word "ahuehuete" is derived from *ahuehuetl* which means “upright drum in water" or “old man of the water,” a reference to its riparian habitat.[^ref1] Epiphytes, such as lichen and bromeliads, often festoon to the ahuehuete tree and hang from its branches, mimicking the appearance of an elderly gentleman. The tree symbolizes the accumulated wisdom of older generations and the preservation of the history, culture, and identity of Nahua-speaking peoples. Prominent Nahua scholar <span url="https://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=267613&p=6643142"> Dr. Natalio Hernández </span> often engages the metaphor of ahuehuete to encourage a return to indigenous practices.[^ref2] Other common names, related to the dominant indigenous language of the reion, include ciprés, pénjamu, sabino, tnuyucu (Mixteca) and yagaguichiciña (Zapotec).[^ref3]

### Giant of the Rivers

The <span eid="Q1429751"> Montezuma cypress </span>, *Taxodium mucronatum*, is a large semi-evergreen conifer. It thrives in a variety of soil types ranging from clay to sand, alkaline to acidic, and can withstand inundation.[^ref4] In fertile soils, it can grow up to six feet per year, but will still grow relatively fast under drought conditions. Montezuma cypress reach heights of 15 to 30 meters, spreading up to 12 meters. Branches droop with 1-2 cm needles spirally arranged along the stems. The ovoid cones are small, only 1.5-2.5 cm long, ripening in October following a springtime bloom. As the tree primarily reproduces by seeds, germination begins as soon as seeds are exposed to favorable moisture conditions.

The Montezuma cypress is native to Mexico and Guatemala, though there are a few stands in southern Texas. As a riparian tree, it favours upland riversides, but may also be found near springs and marshes. When not growing in pure stands, it is commonly found with <span eid="Q163025">*Platanus</span> , <span eid="Q25356">Populus</span>, <span eid="Q36050">Salix*</span>, and <span eid="Q290354">*Inga*</span> species. The oldest known specimens in Mexico are documented in the rain shadow of the Sierra Madre Oriental near Rio Verde, San Luis Potosí. Thousand year old Montezuma cypress grace the banks of stream channels running through a mesquite grassland.[^ref5]

The Montezuma cypress is closely related to the bald cypress, <span eid="Q148950">*Taxodium distichum*</span>, found in the southern United States. Many scientists used to question whether the Mexican specimen was a distinct species or too closely morphologically related to the American bald cypress.[^ref6] Thus in the literature, publications from the 1990s and early 2000s still refer to the Montezuma cypress as a variety of the American species and list the tree as *T. distichum* var *mexicanum*. In reality, *T. mucronatum* has slightly smaller and less variably-sized females comes and rarely develops “knees” at the base of its trunk. It is also not frost-hardy, unlike *T. distichum.*[^ref7]

The ethnobotanical uses of Montezuma bald cypress are quite broad. Bark was burned for an astringent to heal burns, scars, and skin ulcers while the resin, leaves, buds, and fruit were used to treat gout, toothaches, edema, heart conditions, and hemorrhoids.[^ref8] The rot resistant, hard wood was also utilized for furniture, canoes, construction beams, and cooking fuel.

The Montezuma cypress is historically significant to the Mexican people, appearing throughout various <span eid="Q587240">Aztec codices</span>, illustrated manuscripts depicting everything from taxation and trade to history and rituals. The codices provide a record of the mythology that directed how the Aztec interpreted and experienced the world. Mythology was both a record of history and method of reading the landscape as the Aztec attempted to situate themselves in a world dominated by celestial beings. In one codex, Coxcox and Xochiquetzal, the only human survivors of a mythical Aztec flood, were saved by hiding in an ahuehuete [^ref9]. In the Codice Boturini, the arbol quebrado or “broken tree” myth of the Mexica represents the birth of the Mexica people from broken branches of river trees, which many believe to be the ahuehuete. Stories of floods and rivers establish a connection with <span eid="Q232870">Tlaloc</span>, the supreme god of rain, water and fertility.[^ref10] While not there is no explicit link to Tlaloc, the riparian nature of ahuehuete suggests an intimacy in the landscape and imagination.

Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, the Mexica group of Aztecs cultivated Montezuma cypress as ornamental and shade plants. Their association with ancestors and gods of creation evolved into a symbol of government and civic life, making it a popular plant for gardens and city avenues.[^ref11] Researchers believe it was a major feature of the gardens of <span eid="Q141791">Moctezuma II</span>, the sixth Huey Tlatoani or Emperor of the Aztec Empire. As lakes were drained and land paved over time, many trees succumbed to the altered hydrology and loss of habitat.

One of the most impressive is the <span eid="Q252182"> Arbol del Tule </span>, located on the church grounds in Santa Maria del Tule in Oaxaca. With a circumference of 42 m, it is considered to have the largest tree circumference in the world.[^ref12] DNA has proven it is a single tree with many large buttresses. Age estimates range from 1,200-1600 years old, with one local Zapotec legend claiming the tree was planted 1400 years ago by Pechocha, priest of Ehecatl, the Aztec god of wind. Visitors nicknamed Arbol del Tule the "Tree of Life" because of the animals supposedly visible in its gnarled trunk.

### An Agricultural Pillar

Along with willows, <span eid="Q5240848">*Salix lasiolepis*</span>, ahuehuete were one of the trees used to hold together chinampas. <span eid="Q750176"> Chinampa </span> is an agricultural technique that allowed Mesoamerican people to farm in the Mexico Valley, which was constantly flooding.[^ref13] These rectangular "floating islands" of fertile land were built up in wetlands and shallow lakes then planted with crops. 

<param ve-image url="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/03/23/01/16/drone-4959052_1280.jpg"

Chinampas were the literal foundation of the Aztec Empire, supplying food to support a rapidly expanding empire. The geography and hydrology of the Valley of Mexico, the heart of the Aztec civilization, made conventional agricultural practices impossible due to constant flooding.[^ref14] After the establishment of the capital <span eid="Q13695">Tenochtitlán</span> on an island at the edge of Lake Texcoco, land for housing quickly grew scare as the population grew. The same technique used to create chinampas was applied to increase the area of inhabitable land, allowing the Aztec to continue living with water.

       license="attribution non commercial generic">

Construction of chinampas began with staking out a shallow lakebed and creating a wattle fence.[^ref15] The designated fenced area was then piled with mud, lake sediment, and decaying vegetation until the surface peaked just above the water level. Manure and additional compost were commonly added on top for extra nutrients. Because of the constant build up of soils, research has found a high bacterial diversity in cultivated soil compared to non-cultivated soils. The average Nahuatl chinampa measured about 30 m by 2.5 m.[^ref16]

Drainage canals between the floating islands were constructed to accommodate canoes, allowing easy access for maintenance, planting, and harvesting. Because of the ideal growing conditions, chinampas could provide up to seven harvests per year.[^ref17] As environmental historian Jonathan Graham has suggested, these Mesoamerican agricultural systems offer a complex way of living with water as they are simultaneously concave and convex. [^ref18] In concave landscapes, crops were grown close to water, leaving them susceptible to floods. This led to the development of convex landscapes that reversed this geography by placing crops at higher elevations and relying on hydrological technology like aqueducts for irrigation. However, chinampas take advantage of both typologies, adapting to inundated conditions and rising above the lake level to support a variety of crops.

### Where Myth and Nature Meet

While chinampas were critical to the success of the Aztec empire, religious beliefs and practices were similarly integral to the lives of this prosperous society. Since the ahuehuete is tied so closely to the history of the Mesoamerican people, it plays a prominent role throughout different Aztec codices, yet is noticeably absent from the <span eid=”Q2204297”> *Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis* </span>. Commonly referred to as the Badianas Manuscript, this herbal manifesto describing medicinal properties of plants reads similarly to the traditional herbarium sheet, with an added reverence for place that grounds each specimen in its local environment. Rethinking the representation of ahuehuete in botanical drawings suggests the importance of including the cultural element often lost in contemporary herbarium sheets.  

<param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Badianus.jpg"

       author="Martín de la Cruz and translated into Latin by Juan Badianus, 1552"
       license="public domain">

The reimagined herbarium sheet to the right weaves mythology and the legacy of chinampas into the representation of the ahuehuete. Like the Aztec civilization, the chinampa drawing is built upon the Aztec creation myth. In the beginning, the dual god <span eid="Q516456">Ometecuhtli/Omecihuatl</span> created itself and its four children which represented the cardinal directions.[^ref19] The four gods began creating the world, starting with water, other deities, and a sea monster named Cipactli. Cipactli was part fish and crocodile, a voracious creature that ate every creation that fell into the water. Eventually the gods attacked the monster, finally defeating her and establishing the universe from her body. Thirteen heavens stretched from her head to her tail, with earth in the middle.[^ref20] In one interpretation, the world is literally built on the back of Cipactli, thus, the scaly monster grounds the soil at the bottom of the drawing.

In this reinterpreted drawing, culture and ecology are intertwined. The material inputs that characterize the soil profile of a typical chinampa are interspersed with Aztec symbology that grounds the representation. The idea of inundation is implied through the face mask of <span data-click-image-zoomto="2679,4032,838,840">Tlaloc and the Aztec iconography for rain</span>. His presence ties the chinampas hydrologically and spiritually to mythology. As the giver of life and sustenance, Tlaloc had the power to both nourish the land or obliterate crops with torrential floods. Even with the evangelization of locals by the Spanish during colonization,[^ref21] the presence of Tlaloc persists in religion, media, and civic life, just as the chinampas continue to support communities. The legacy of the ahuehuete and Tlaloc both establish a common modern Mexican identity.

The chinampa may sustain the community, but only with the foundation of ahuehuete and its roots.

The ahuehuete, like the chinampas, is a symbol of prosperity, power, and memory, representing more than just a united nation. It is both ancestor and brother of the Mesoamerican people, carrying the history, culture, and identity of communities across Mexico. From its ethnobotanical and religious uses to its structural applications in agriculture, the ahuehuete maintains its prominence in contemporary Mexican culture.
