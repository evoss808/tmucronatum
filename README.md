       *Taxodium mucronatum: Enduring Old Man*

Rising from the banks of streams and riparian edges, the Montezuma cypress (*Taxodium mucronatum*) establishes a presence of strength and beauty. Recognized as the national tree of <span eid="Q26">Mexico</span>, the Montezuma cypress plays a significant role in Mesoamerican history and culture. The tree has many common names depending on the indigenous language of the region where it grows including ciprés, pénjamu, sabino, ahuehuete (Nahuatl), tnuyucu (Mixteca) and yagaguichiciña (Zapotec).

The Montezuma cypress (*Taxodium mucronatum*) is a large semi-evergreen conifer. It thrives in a variety of soil types ranging from clay to sand, alkaline to acidic, and can withstand inundation. In fertile soils, it can grow up to six feet per year, but will still grow relatively fast under drought conditions. Montezuma cypress reach heights of 15 to 30 meters, spreading up to 12 meters.  Branches droop with 1-2 cm needles spirally arranged along the stems. The ovoid cones are small, only 1.5-2.5 cm long, ripening in October following a springtime bloom. As the tree primarily reproduces by seeds, germination begins as soon as moisture conditions permit once they are released.

The Montezuma cypress is native to Mexico and Guatemala, though there are a few stands in Cameron and Hidalgo counties in Texas. As a riparian tree, it favours upland riversides, but may also be found near springs and marshes. When not growing in pure stands, it is commonly found with *Platanus, Populus, Salix*, and *Inga* species. The oldest known specimens in Mexico have been documented in the rain shadow of the Sierra Madre Oriental near Rio Verde, San Luis Potosí. Montezuma cypress over 1000 years old grace the banks of the stream channels that run through mesquite grassland.

The Montezuma cypress is closely related to the bald cypress (*Taxodium distichum*) found in the southern United States. It used to be listed as a variety of the US species as scientists debated whether the specimen in Mexico was a distinct species or too closely morphologically related to the American bald cypress. In the literature, publications from the 1990s and early 2000s still refer to the Montezuma cypress as *T. distichum* var *mexicanum*. *T. mucrontaum* has slightly smaller and less variably-sized females comes and rarely develops “knees” at the base of its trunk. It is also not frost-hardy, unlike *T. distichum.*

The Montezuma cypress belongs to the Cupressaceae family, one of the oldest plant families. The taxodiod clade became a distinct group from its ancestor in the Cretaceous period about 100 million years ago. The original ancestral species was dependent on moist conditions, a trait *T. mucronatum* retained. 

The ethnobotanical uses of Montezuma bald cypress are quite broad. Bark was burned for an astringent to heal burns, scars, and skin ulcers while the resin, leaves, buds, and fruit were used to treat gout, toothaches, edema, heart conditions, and hemorrhoids. The rot resistant, hard wood was also utilized for furniture, canoes, construction beams, and cooking fuel.

In <span eid="Q13300">Nahuatl </span>, the bald cypress is known as “ahuehuete”. This is derived from ahuehuetl which means “upright drum in water or “old man of the water,” related to its riparian habitat. The “old” part refers to the epiphytes, such lichen and bromeliads, that festoon to the ahuehuete tree and hang from its branches. The tree symbolizes the accumulated wisdom of older generations and the preservation of the history, culture, and identity of Nahua-speaking peoples. Prominent Nahua scholar <span url="https://guides.lib.byu.edu/c.php?g=267613&p=6643142"> Dr Hernandez </span> often utilizes the ahuehuete as a metaphor in his writings, calling for the Nahua people to return to their roots.

Though it does not appear in the Badianus manuscript, the Montezuma cypress is historically significant to the Mexican people. It is featured in one of the Zapotec creation myths and appears throughout various Aztec codices. In one codex, Coxcox and Xochiquetzal, the only human survivors of the mythical Aztec flood, were saved by hiding in an ahuehuete [footnote]. In the Codice Boturini, the arbol quebrado or “broken tree” myth of the Mexica represents the birth of the Mexica people from broken branches of river trees, which man believe to be the ahuehuete.

Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, the Mexica group of Aztecs cultivated the Montezuma cypress as ornamental or shade plants. Their symbolism as ancestors, brothers, and gods associated with creation stories evolved into a symbol of government, making it a popular plant for gardens and city avenues. Researchers believe it was a major feature of the gardens of Moctezuma, the sixth Huey Tlatoani or Emperor of the Aztec Empire. As lakes were drained and land paved over, many of the trees have succumbed to the altered hydrology and habitat loss.

One of the most impressive is the <span eid="Q252182"> Arbol del Tule </span>, located on the church grounds in Santa Maria del Tule in Oaxaca. With a circumference of 42 m, it is considered to have the largest tree circumference in the world. DNA has proven it is a single tree with many large buttresses. Age estimates range from 1,200-1600 years old, with one local Zapotec legend claiming the tree was planted 1400 years ago by Pechocha, priest of Ehecatl, the Aztec god of wind.

Along with willows (*Salix lasiolepis*), ahuehuete were one of the trees used to hold together chinampas. <span eid="Q750176"> Chinampa </span>, also known as “floating islands,” is an agricultural technique that allowed Mesoamerican people to farm in the Mexico Valley. Rectangular areas of fertile land are built up in wetlands and freshwater swamps then planted with crops. The average Nahuatl chinampas measured about 30 m by 2.5 m.

Construction began with staking out a shallow lakebed and creating a wattle fence. The designated fenced area was then piled with mud, lake sediment, and decaying vegetation until the surface peaked just above the water level. Manure and additional compost were commonly added as the top layer for extra nutrients. Because of the constant build up of soils, research has found a high bacterial diversity in cultivated soil compared to non-cultivated soils.

Drainage canals between the floating islands were constructed to accommodate canoes, allowing easy access for maintenance, planting, and harvesting. Because of the ideal growing conditions, chinampas could provide up to seven harvest per year. As environmental historian Jonathan Graham has suggested, these Mesoamerican agricultural systems offer a complex way of living with water as they are simultaneously concave and convex. In concave landscapes, crops were grown close to water, which left them susceptible to floods. This led to convex landscapes that reversed the geography by placing crops at higher elevations and relying on hydrological technology like aqueducts to water plants. However, chinampas take advantage of both typologies, adapting to inundated conditions and rising from the lakes to support a variety of crops.

Chinampas were the literal foundation of the Aztec Empire, supplying food to support a rapidly expanding empire. The geography and hydrology of the Valley of Mexico, the heart of the Aztec civilization, made conventional agricultural practices impossible due to constant flooding. After the establishment of the capital Tenochtitlán on an island at the edge of Lake Texcoco, land for housing quickly grew scare as the population grew. The same technique used to create chinampas was applied to increase the area of inhabitable land, allowing the Aztecs to continue living with water.

Just as the chinampas were critical to the success of the Aztec empire, mythology drove their customs and culture. Because the ahuehuete is tied so closely to the history of the Mesoamerican people, this mythology was incorporated into the various layers of the herbarium drawing. The idea of inundation is implied through the face mask of Tlaloc and the iconography for rain. Tlaloc was the supreme god of rain, as well as god of fertility and water, the giver of life and sustenance. His inclusion ties the chinampas hydrologically and spiritually to mythology.

Like the Aztec civilization, the chinampa drawing is built upon the Aztec creation myth. In the beginning, the dual god Ometecuhtli/Omecihuatl created itself and its four children which represented the cardinal directions. The four gods then got to work creating the world, starting with water, other deities, and a sea monster Cipactli. Cipactli was part fish and crocodile, a voracious creature that ate every creation that fell into the water. Eventually the gods attacked the monster, finally defeating her and establishing the universe from her body. Thirteen heavens stretched from her head to her tail, with earth in the middle. In one interpretation, the world is literally built on the back of Cipactli, thus, the scaly monster grounds the soil in the reimagined herbarium sheet.

In this reinterpreted herbarium sheet, culture and ecology are intertwined. Each layer is filled with soil characters that represent that corresponding material inputs, built on the foundation of the Aztec symbology. Aquatic vegetation and compost at the bottom of the pile is topped with alternating layers of earth and mud comprised of rocks, minerals, and bacteria. The final compost layer keeps everything moist and fertile. Interspersed are more symbols of water. Hidden within the layers are the Five Suns, a final nod to the Aztec and Nahua creation myths. They believed the world was created and destroyed four times before the present world came to being.

The ahuehuete, like the chinampas, is a symbol of prosperity, power, and memory, representing more than just a united nation. They are both ancestor and brother of the Mesoamerican people, carrying the history, culture, and identity of communities across Mexico. From its ethnobotanical and religious uses to its structural applications in agriculture, the ahuehuete maintains its prominence in contemporary Mexican culture.
